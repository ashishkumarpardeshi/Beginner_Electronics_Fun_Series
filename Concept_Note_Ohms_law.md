# Concept Note for Basic Electronics Fun Series

This Concept note is to engage Students and Educators passionatly to do projects/activities around basic electronics along with thier peers in a playful environment.

The goal of this concept note is to curate the Basic electronics project/activities to cover the followings:

1. Passive Components (Resistor, LDR, Capacitor)
2. Active Components (Transitors)
3. Ohms Law
4. Series and Parallel Circuits
5. Voltage, Current, Power, Resistance, etc Measurements


### Projects:
Title: Basic Electronics Fun Series

1. Polarity Detector
2. Variable Brightness LED
3. Voltage Level Indicator
